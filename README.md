# Clipboard Formatter

Clipboard Formatter is a small Rust program that formats things you copy to your clipboard. 

What it Formats:

- Phone Numbers
`
(123) 456-7890
`
-> 
`
1234567890
`

- MAC Addresses
`
00:11:22:33:44:55
`
->
`
0011.2233.4455
`

In the future, I plan to add more formatting options and maybe a configuration file to add your own formatting rules, using regex.

This project is probably not very useful to a majority of people, but it's useful to me to use during work when I have to copy and paste a lot of phone numbers and MAC addresses into this format.
